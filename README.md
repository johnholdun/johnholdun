Hey it’s me! I’m John (he/him). I live in Los Angeles.

I work at [Postlight](https://github.com/postlight) as a Principal Engineer and I create themed attractions as the founder of [Variable Stage](https://variablestage.com).

My blog and everything is on [johnholdun.com](https://johnholdun.com). Don't miss my very opinionated guides on [Building Frontends](https://johnholdun.com/frontends/) and [The Elements of APIs](https://johnholdun.com/apis/)!

Okay bye!
